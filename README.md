## Data Script:

For this analysis, I utilized the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) to develop an automated Python script. This script efficiently extracts cryptocurrency data every 30 minutes, allowing for a timely and accurate overview of the market trends. The data is neatly organized in a CSV file, making it easy to analyze and draw insights. This approach not only streamlines the data collection process but also brings a fresh perspective to understanding the fast-paced world of digital currencies.
