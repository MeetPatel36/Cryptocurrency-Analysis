## Data Script:

For this analysis, I utilized the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) to develop an automated Python script. This script efficiently extracts the data for the top 100 cryptocurrencies every 30 minutes, allowing for a timely and accurate overview of market trends. The data is neatly organized in a CSV file, making it easy to analyze and draw insights. This approach not only streamlines the data collection process but also brings a fresh perspective to understanding the fast-paced world of digital currencies.

## Next Steps: 

For the next steps in my project, I will begin by gathering an extensive dataset over the course of a week to ensure a robust foundation for analysis. Following this data collection phase, I plan to create an interactive dashboard for each cryptocurrency, enabling us to track their performance in real-time effectively. Finally, I will develop a predictive machine learning model aimed at forecasting cryptocurrency prices, which will help us gain valuable insights and make informed decisions in this dynamic market.
